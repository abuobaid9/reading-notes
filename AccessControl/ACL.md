# Access Control (ACL)

## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

## Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC:-

1. Inventory your systems
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles
4. Never make one-off changes
5. Audit

## What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- Analyze your workforce and create roles

## What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain

Access Rights are the permissions an individual user or a computer application holds to read, write, modify, delete or otherwise access a computer file; change configurations or settings, or add or remove applications. An organization’s network or information technology administrator can define permissions for files, servers, folders or specific applications on the computer.

## Benefits Of RBAC

- Security: RBAC improves overall security as it relates to compliance, confidentiality, privacy, and access management to resources and other sensitive data and systems.
- Selective access: RBAC systems can support users having multiple roles at the same with specific permissions for each role.
- Security as a function of organizational structure: allows organizations to impose hierarchies for assigning permissions based on the seniority or topology of organizations.
- Separation of duties (SoD): is the concept that no one person has sole control over a task. SoD benefits organizations as cyber-attacks on a single account won’t cause significant harm to systems. 
- Flexibility: IT organizations can review and adjust permissions associated with each role periodically.
