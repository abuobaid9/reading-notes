# SQL Vs NoSQL :-

| SQL      |      NoSQL      |  
|----------|:-------------:|
| Data uses Schemas |  Schemas-less |
| Relations | No (or very few) Relations  |
| Data is distributed acroos multiple tables | Data is typically merged / nested in a few collections |
| Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible;Vertical sacling is possible | Both Horizontal and Vertical scaling is possible |
|Limnitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second| Great performance for mass (simple) read & write requests|

## Horizontal scaling  Vs  Vertical sacling :-

| Horizontal scaling    |   Vertical sacling |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Add More Servers( and merge Data into one Database )|  Improve Server Capacity / Hardware  |

## Examples :-

- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.
- NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

## Sequelize v6 :-

    Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift and Snowflakeâ€™s Data Cloud. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

-Ex :

```js
const { Sequelize, Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:');

class User extends Model {}
User.init({
  username: DataTypes.STRING,
  birthday: DataTypes.DATE
}, { sequelize, modelName: 'user' });

(async () => {
  await sequelize.sync();
  const jane = await User.create({
    username: 'janedoe',
    birthday: new Date(1980, 6, 20)
  });
  console.log(jane.toJSON());
})();
```
