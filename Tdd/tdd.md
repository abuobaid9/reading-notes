# Express/Node

## What is Node?

Node is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS).

From a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:

* Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications
* Code is written in "plain old JavaScript"
* JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages
* The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages.
* Node.js is portable.
* It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.

### Web Frameworks:-

Other common web-development tasks are not directly supported by Node itself. If you want to add specific handling for different HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), separately handle requests at different URL paths ("routes"), serve static files, or use templates to dynamically create the response, Node won't be of much use on its own. You will either need to write the code yourself, or you can avoid reinventing the wheel and use a web framework.

## What is Express?

Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.

### Where did Node and Express come from?

Node was initially released, for Linux only, in 2009. The NPM package manager was released in 2010, and native Windows support was added in 2012.

### How popular are Node and Express?

The popularity of a web framework is important because it is an indicator of whether it will continue to be maintained, and what resources are likely to be available in terms of documentation, add-on libraries, and technical support.

## What is NPM ?

npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

* npm consists of three distinct components:

1. the website
2. the Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. the registry

## for what we use npm?

* Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
* Download standalone tools you can use right away.
* Run packages without downloading using npx.
* Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
* Restrict code to specific developers.
* Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
* Form virtual teams by using organizations.
* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
* Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

## What is TDD?

“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).
